üëã Hey there, it's me, **OneDollarCat**! üò∫
## ‚ùì What is this?
This is a folder in my **problem-practice** repo called **sloth-bytes**!
## ‚ùì What is this for? And what even is Sloth Bytes?
Well, there's a YouTuber called [The Coding Sloth](www.youtube.com/@TheCodingSloth) whose channel is based on programming, and he's also really funny, go check out his videos!  
Ok, back to the topic:  
He also has a great newsletter called [Sloth Bytes](slothbytes.beehiiv.com), where he gives **weekly *bite-sized* info** and advice to make *you* a better programmer!  
And at the end of each mail, there's a **Weekly Challenge** section where he gives a problem to solve by making a *function*.  
And this is where I make *my solutions* to his problems.

Ok, that's all for now, `</OneDollarCat>`

(P.S.: If you reached all the way here, **subscribe** to [his channel](www.youtube.com/@TheCodingSloth) and **follow** [his newsletter](slothbytes.beehiiv.com) as well, trust me, it's *great*.  
[**Disclaimer**: I have *not* been paid to praise Sloth!]
